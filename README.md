-Start


-initialize Total to get the total number of paths 


- initialize Number of routes as we have four routes

-If we start at A there are three possible routes for us to take 


-If we choose to travel to B we then have two choices of where to go next 


-If we travel to C it leaves just one route left 


-We now have visited all destinations and can find the number of possible routes by multiplying the number of choices we had at each point 
Total= 3*2*1=6


-Choose a vertex to start from 


-Find the distance of each route 


-Compare the distance of each route
